This package provides means to train and use incremental SFA.
This implementation is interfaced in :py:mod:`core.semantic`, where unifying methods are
introduced to deal with batch and incremental SFA similarly.

This package is unaltered from Kompella et al. 2012
except that the progress bar console output was commented out.
