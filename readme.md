#### In a nutshell

This computational model was used to study the interaction between episodic memory in the
hippocampus and sensory representations in the neocortex. Episodes are stored in terms of
a low-level representation of the sensory experiences (SFA<sub>lo</sub>). The higher-level
sensory representation (SFA<sub>hi</sub>) is trained either during the sensory
experience (without episodic memory) or based on sequences retrieved from memory, perhaps
during a process of systems consolidation. Different methods can be used to simulate
retrieval: Memory of the episodes can repeatedly be retrieved faithfully, or novel
sequences can be generated by tying together episode fragments that fit smoothly.
